| **Infrastructure** | Docker Compose (Postgres + Redis + API) |

## Features

### Account Management
- Connect bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and investment accounts via Plaid Link
- **Managed or Bring Your Own Plaid** -- hosted instances can offer managed Plaid credentials so users connect instantly; alternatively each household configures its own Plaid API keys in Settings; one-time onboarding choice (managed vs BYOK) with no switching
- **Managed or Bring Your Own LLM** -- admin can configure app-level LLM credentials for managed AI categorization; users choose managed, BYOK, or skip during onboarding; switchable in Settings at any time
- **Admin Plaid config** -- instance admin can configure app-level Plaid credentials, toggle managed mode, and see how many households use it (managed via Admin Panel → Plaid Config tab)
- **Admin LLM config** -- instance admin can configure app-level LLM credentials (base URL, API key, model), toggle enabled, and see managed household count (Admin Panel → LLM Config tab)
- Supports US and Canadian institutions
- Automatic balance refresh on every sync
- Account type and subtype selection during creation, with editable subtypes
- **Edit account modal** -- consolidated edit dialog for name, type, subtype, and balance; balance is disabled for Plaid accounts with an explanatory note
- Unlink individual accounts or revoke full institution connections with confirmation dialog
- **Sync feedback** -- clear "Synced" or "Sync failed" status after each connection sync
- **Dashboard quick actions** -- Link Account, Add Account, and Add Partner buttons in the dashboard header; Add Account navigates to the accounts page with the add form pre-opened
- **Plaid setup banner** -- dismissible dashboard banner prompts household owners to configure Plaid when not yet set up
- **Click-to-filter** -- click any account row to navigate to the Transactions page pre-filtered by that account
- Accounts page hides unlinked accounts by default (toggle to show all)
- **Manual accounts** -- create accounts without Plaid (all types: depository, credit, loan, investment)
- Manually adjust balances on manual accounts at any time
- Delete manual or unlinked accounts (cascades associated transactions and goal links)
- **Statement reminders** -- set a recurring day-of-month (1-31) per account for statement availability; triggers an in-app banner and email reminder on that day (with last-day-of-month fallback for days 29-31)

### Transaction Management
- Automatic transaction sync from all linked Plaid items
- Manual transaction entry with merchant name, amount, date, category, and notes
- **CSV import** -- bulk import accounts & transactions from bank exports with a multi-step wizard; auto-creates accounts, categorizes transactions, skips duplicates, and lets you set account type, subtype, and starting balance per new account
  - Drag-and-drop or file picker upload
  - Auto-detects common column headers (date, description, amount, category)
  - Supports single Amount column or separate Debit/Credit columns for banks that report withdrawals and deposits as positive numbers in different columns
  - Preview mapped transactions with color-coded amounts before importing
  - Duplicate detection skips previously imported rows
- **Infinite scroll** -- browse the full transaction history with automatic pagination (loads 50 at a time as you scroll)
- Server-side search by merchant name with filters for category, account, source (manual vs synced), and uncategorized
- **Filter popover** -- secondary filters (category, type, date range, amount range) collapsed behind a Filters button with active-filter count badge; click outside to dismiss
- Inline auto-categorization: each transaction is categorized at import time (rules first, then per-transaction LLM fallback) with real-time streaming progress; optional **skip AI categorization** toggle for faster imports
- Manual "auto-categorize" button with streaming progress bar (current/total, merchant name, assigned category) and tooltip describing the AI/rules categorization process
- **Delete confirmation** -- manual transaction deletion requires confirmation via dialog; Plaid-synced transactions are protected
- **Rule suggestion on categorize** -- after manually categorizing a transaction, an inline card offers to create a category rule from the merchant name with multiple keyword options (full name, cleaned name, progressive word combinations); skipped if a matching rule already exists
- **Inline transaction editing** -- pencil button on every transaction row expands an inline form to edit merchant name, category, amount (with expense/income toggle), date, and notes; only one row editable at a time; category change from null triggers rule suggestion

### Hybrid Categorization
1. **Rule-based** -- user-defined keyword-to-category mappings checked first
2. **LLM fallback** -- uncategorized transactions are sent one-at-a-time to an OpenAI-compatible model for classification; per-transaction calls are resilient (individual failures don't block others)
3. **Inline categorization** -- each transaction is categorized at import time (rules first, then per-transaction LLM fallback) with real-time streaming progress via NDJSON
4. **Streaming auto-categorize** -- the manual auto-categorize endpoint streams NDJSON progress events, showing per-transaction categorization status with a progress bar on the frontend
5. Auto-categorization also runs on every Plaid sync and can be triggered manually for any remaining uncategorized transactions

### Tags
- Create user-defined tags with custom colors
- Attach multiple tags to any transaction
- Filter and organize spending with tag-based labels

### Budgets
- Monthly category budgets with configurable amounts; **click-to-edit** inline amount editing
- Optional rollover of unspent budget to the next month (tooltip explains rollover behavior)
- **Inline add-budget validation** -- amount now shows explicit feedback when invalid (e.g. `0` or empty) instead of silently staying disabled
- **Click-to-filter** -- click any budget row to navigate to the Transactions page pre-filtered by that category and month date range
- **Accessible progress bars** -- ARIA `progressbar` role with `aria-valuenow`/`aria-valuemax`
- Copy all budgets from one month to another
- **Shared budgets** -- create household-level budgets editable by either partner
- **Per-person spending breakdown** -- shared budget rows show a two-tone progress bar with per-person contribution amounts
- **Spending preferences** -- when both a personal and shared budget exist for the same category, choose where your spending counts
- **Sectioned household view** -- household scope groups budgets into "Your Budgets", "Partner's Budgets", and "Shared Budgets" sections
- Dashboard snippet shows personal/shared totals and expanded shared category rows in Mine, Yours, and Ours views

### Financial Goals
- Set savings goals with target amount, target date, icon, and color
- Track current progress toward each goal
- **Shared goals** -- create household-level goals that either partner can contribute to
- **Account-linked goals** -- link one or more accounts to auto-track progress from balances (updated on every Plaid sync)
- **Contribution history** -- expandable log showing who added what, with user avatar, amount, note, and date
- **Inline goal validation** -- create and contribution dialogs show explicit messages for invalid amounts (including `0`)
- Dashboard snippet shows expanded shared goal rows in Mine, Yours, and Ours views

### Validation UX + Error Contract
- API request validation errors now include a normalized payload with `message`, `detail`, and `field_errors` (`field`, `message`, `code`)
- Frontend API client parses validation payloads and surfaces cleaner user-facing mutation errors instead of raw `API error 422: ...` blobs
- Core create/update flows now pair disabled submit states with explicit validation text for invalid required fields (including numeric `> 0` checks where business rules require it)
- Expanded inline/mutation feedback now covers budget and goal amounts, account-name creation, add-transaction amount validation, create-account/create-transaction mutation failures, and household invite email format errors
- **No-shift layout** -- validation errors use reserved-height containers (`min-h` + `opacity` transition) and `aria-invalid` red-bordered inputs so error messages never push adjacent fields out of alignment

### Net Worth Tracking
- Automatic net worth snapshots taken after every Plaid sync, manual account creation, and balance update
- Historical net worth chart on the dashboard (assets, liabilities, net) with correct rendering for single data points
- Manual snapshot trigger via API
- **Balance history CSV import** -- bulk import accounts & balances from a CSV with date, balance, and account name columns to backfill historical net worth; auto-creates accounts if needed, supports matching to existing accounts, and recalculates net worth snapshots

### Cash Flow Visualization
- **Interactive bar chart** -- side-by-side income vs. expenses across months, quarters, or years
- **Drill-down** -- click any bar to see category breakdown, click a category to see individual transactions
- Breadcrumb navigation and back button at each drill level
- Period pickers (month, quarter, year) with navigation

### Recurring Transaction Detection
- Automatic frequency analysis (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual)
- Amount consistency detection
- Next expected date projection
- Dashboard widget showing upcoming recurring charges

### Reports
- Spending by category (pie/bar breakdown for any date range)
- Monthly trends (income, expenses, savings rate over time)
- Category trends (per-category spend month-over-month)
- Top merchants by total spend

### Household Sharing
- **Auto-household** -- every new user gets a personal household on signup, ensuring a place to store Plaid credentials even before inviting a partner
- Invite a partner by email to form a household
- Three view modes across the entire app:
  - **Mine** -- only your accounts, transactions, budgets, and goals
  - **Yours** -- view-only access to your partner's data
  - **Ours** -- combined household view with shared budgets/goals
- Owner badges (name + avatar) on accounts, transactions, and connections in shared views
- Shared budgets and goals are editable by either household member
- Partner's personal budgets and goals are visible but read-only
- **Dashboard partner status** -- shows "Sharing with {name}" badge when a partner exists, or an "Add Partner" button with invite dialog when not
- Invitation accept/decline/cancel flow with banner notifications; accepting dissolves the invitee's solo household (including its Plaid config) and warns if they have linked Plaid items
- Editable household name (displayed in ViewSwitcher)
- Leave household at any time; personal data is unaffected

### Profile Management
- Editable display name override (falls back to Google name when cleared)
- Custom avatar URL (falls back to Google profile picture when cleared)
- Optional short bio/tagline (up to 300 characters)
- Read-only email from Google OAuth
- Reset buttons to revert individual fields to Google defaults
- Profile changes reflect immediately in the sidebar

### Admin Panel
- **Multi-admin system** -- admin role persisted on user model; `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var bootstraps first admin on login; admins can promote/demote other users
- **Overview dashboard** -- clickable KPI cards for total users, active users (7d/30d), accounts (linked/manual), transactions, households, recent errors; clicking a KPI navigates to the relevant tab with pre-applied filters
- **User management** -- paginated, searchable user list with per-user stats (accounts, transactions, last active); filterable by active users (N days), linked accounts, manual accounts, sortable by account count; toggle admin, disable/enable (soft-ban), or permanently delete users with full FK cascade
- **User detail drill-down** -- expandable user rows showing accounts, recent transactions, recent activity timeline, and summary stats (total transactions, categories used, rules/tags created)
- **Plaid health** -- aggregated Plaid sync/link errors with recent failure details
- **Error log** -- paginated, filterable error log (by type, user, date range)
- **Analytics** -- DAU/WAU/MAU time series with bar charts, feature adoption rates (budgets, goals, tags, categories, rules, linked accounts), transaction volume bar chart, storage metrics (row counts per table)
- **Plaid Config** -- dedicated tab for managing app-level Plaid credentials (client ID, secret, environment), toggling managed mode, and removing config; moved from Settings page
- **Activity tracking** -- `ActivityLog` model records user actions (login, sync, import, categorize, etc.) for analytics
- **Disabled user enforcement** -- disabled users receive 403 on all authenticated endpoints
- **Sidebar integration** -- Admin link appears conditionally for admin users
- **Timestamps** -- all 24 models have `created_at` (auto-set on insert) and `updated_at` (auto-set on ORM flush via `before_flush` listener); idempotent startup migration ensures columns exist in production

### Authentication & Multi-User
- Google Sign-In with one-tap and popup flows
- JWT session stored as an HttpOnly cookie
- All data is scoped per-user (accounts, transactions, rules, settings, budgets, goals) with household-aware sharing
- User profile display in sidebar with avatar (prefers profile overrides)

### Security & Reliability
- Startup validation for critical config (`JWT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`)
- Enforces `SECURE_COOKIES=true` when `DEBUG=false`
- Security response headers (`X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, CSP, conditional HSTS)
- Configurable per-route and global rate limiting (`memory` or `redis` backend)
- Readiness endpoint (`/health/ready`) checks database and Redis dependencies

### Global Categorization Progress Drawer
- **Persistent progress drawer** -- fixed bottom-right card shows real-time progress during Plaid sync and auto-categorization, surviving page navigation
- **Sync phase** -- displays institution name and account progress (e.g. "Syncing Chase... Account 1 of 3")
- **Categorization phase** -- shows merchant name, assigned category badge, and progress bar (current/total)
- **Completion summary** -- displays synced count, categorized count, and skipped count
- **Error handling** -- displays error message with dismiss button
- **Manual dismiss** -- completion and error states show an X button to reset to idle
- Triggers from both the Sync Now button (connections page) and Auto-Categorize button (transactions page)
- Backed by a global React Context (`CategorizationProgressProvider`) that wraps the app, streaming NDJSON events from the backend

### Navigation & Layout
- **Mobile-responsive sidebar** -- hamburger toggle for small screens with overlay drawer
- **Categories nav link** -- sidebar includes a dedicated Categories page link
- Sidebar supports mobile open/close with backdrop click-to-dismiss
- Main content uses responsive margin (`lg:ml-60`) for proper layout on all screen sizes

### Settings & Configuration
- **Profile & Account** -- display name, avatar URL, bio (with Google fallback)
- **General** -- currency (CAD, USD, EUR, GBP, etc.), date format, number locale; "Settings saved" flash on save
- **Sync Schedule** -- per-household sync config (enable/disable, hour, minute, timezone); owner-only editing; "Schedule saved" flash on save; each household gets its own cron job on its own schedule
- **AI Categorization** — mode-aware: shows "Using managed AI" badge with switch button when managed, or BYOK config form (base URL, model, API key) with switch-to-managed button when BYOK; switchable between managed/BYOK at any time
- **Integrations** -- household owner configures Plaid client ID, secret, and environment (sandbox/development/production); credentials encrypted at rest with Fernet; masked last-4 display for verification; auto-scrolls via `?section=integrations` deep link
- **Data Management** -- CSV export, Bulk Import Accounts & Transactions, Bulk Import Accounts & Balances, bulk delete, factory reset (wipes all financial data while preserving login and household), delete account (permanently removes user and all data with household cleanup)
- Category rules management is on the dedicated Categories page

### Dashboard
- Net worth hero card with total assets, liabilities, and net worth
- Net worth history SVG line chart with hover tooltips
- Top spending movers (biggest category changes)
- Budget and goals summary snippets
- Credit cards widget (balances, limits, utilization)
- Loans widget (balances and payment info)
- Recurring charges widget
- Uncategorized transactions snippet
- Sync-all button

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 16 (or Docker)
- A [Plaid](https://dashboard.plaid.com/) account (free sandbox)
- A [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) OAuth 2.0 Client ID

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd personal-finance
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in:
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` -- generate with `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` from Google Cloud Console
- `JWT_SECRET` -- generate with `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`

Plaid credentials are configured per-household in Settings (Integrations) or via admin-managed mode. LLM credentials are either admin-managed or per-household BYOK in Settings (AI Categorization).

### 2. Start dependencies

**With Docker:**
```bash
docker compose up -d db redis
```

**Without Docker (local Postgres):**
```bash
createdb finance
# Optional: run Redis locally if RATE_LIMIT_BACKEND=redis
# Update DATABASE_URL / REDIS_URL in .env to point to your local services
```

### 3. Start the backend

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API creates all database tables automatically on startup.

### 4. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env.local   # set NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in with Google.

### Docker (full stack)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts Postgres on `127.0.0.1:5432` and the API on `127.0.0.1:8000`. The frontend runs separately via `npm run dev` in the `frontend/` directory.

Container health checks:
- `db`: `pg_isready`
- `redis`: `redis-cli ping`
- `api`: probes `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/ready`

## Testing

### Backend (pytest)

The backend test suite uses pytest with an in-memory SQLite database, so no external services are needed.

```bash
cd personal-finance
pip install -r requirements.txt   # includes pytest
python3 -m pytest                 # run all tests
python3 -m pytest -v              # verbose output
python3 -m pytest tests/test_auth.py  # run a single file
```

**Test infrastructure:**
- jsdom environment with global mocks for `next/image`, `next/link`, `next/navigation`
- Shared fixtures for users, households, invitations, and settings
- Mock API factory with `vi.hoisted()` for proper hoisting with `vi.mock`
- `renderWithProviders` wrapper with isolated `QueryClient` per test

LLM credentials are either managed by the instance admin (Admin Panel → LLM Config) or configured per-household in Settings > AI Categorization (BYOK mode). Households choose their LLM mode during onboarding and can switch in Settings.

## Security

- Designed to run on `localhost` behind a VPN -- not exposed to the public internet
- Plaid access tokens and per-household Plaid API credentials are encrypted at rest with Fernet symmetric encryption
- JWT sessions use HttpOnly cookies (not accessible via JavaScript), with `Secure` in non-debug mode
- LLM API keys are encrypted at rest and never returned to the frontend (only last 4 chars shown); Plaid credentials are returned masked (last 4 chars only)
- All data queries are scoped to the authenticated user
- CORS is configurable via `CORS_ORIGINS`
- API applies baseline security headers on all responses
- Rate limiting can be run in-memory (single instance) or Redis-backed (multi-instance)

## Troubleshooting Notes

- **Cross-user data visible after account switch**: caused by stale React Query cache reused across sessions.
- **Mitigation in codebase**: `frontend/components/auth-provider.tsx` clears query cache on login, logout, and authenticated user-id changes.
- **Verification**: login as user A, view data, logout, login as user B, then refresh target pages and confirm only user B data is shown.
